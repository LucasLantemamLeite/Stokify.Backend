# 🚀 Stokify.Backend

**Stokify.Backend** is the **server-side** part of the Stokify application, a stock manager and simulator 🏭, allowing you to:

- Add **products**, **warehouses**, and **users** 👤
- Support **multi-tenant** 🏢, where each company operates independently
- Control **maximum and current volume** in warehouses 📦
- Automatically calculate **density** to determine remaining volume 🧮

## 🗄️ Database

Chosen: **PostgreSQL** ✅

- High performance
- Easy to use

## 🏗️ Project Origin

Stokify started from an **old stock simulator** that was never put into production.  
Fun fact: in Python, I made a version with **StreamLit** and **4 .txt files** as the database 😅 (totally crazy!)
